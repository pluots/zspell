# Changelog

<!-- next-header -->


## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Additions

Publish the work in progress command line interface under crate name
`zspell-cli`.

### Changed

- Add support for nonstandard morphological information types.
- Fix issue where all morph information for an affix rule were being reported,
  rather than just that for the relevant pattern. Fixes
  [#73](https://github.com/pluots/zspell/issues/73).
- Rewrite the `.dic` file parser.
- Improve handling of morphological information in dictionary files.

## [0.5.0] - 2023-10-30

Immediately superceded release, see 0.5.1.

## [0.4.1] - 2023-10-18

### Additions

- Add `Dictionary::{entry, entries}` which allow stemming and morphological
  analysis.

### Fixed

- Corrected error message for parsing affix headers
- Corrected pattern matching for groups that include hyphens
- Default no longer has a nosuggest flag
- Change output directory to use cargo directory rather than source

### Changed

- Remove features `unstable-analysis` and `unstable-stem` since functionality is
  now public
- Wordlist now correctly applies more than one affix rule if it is available
- Moved `DictBuilder::config` behind `zspell-unstable`
- [build] update CI workflows
- [internal] make some changes from `TryFrom` to `FromStr`
- [internal] refactor test system to support stemming and morphological analysis

## [0.4.0] - 2023-10-18

## [0.3.3] - 2023-01-01

### Changed

- [build] update python release workflow

## [0.3.2] - 2023-01-01

### Changed

- `.dic` parser now ignores lines that start with a tab (sometimes used for
  comments)
- Updated python documentation

## [0.3.1] - 2022-12-30

Minor patch to build system workflow

## [0.3.0] - 2022-12-30

This change is a huge rewrite of the library! Hopefully this will pave the way
forward for more features and easier growth.

### Changes

- Added `DictBuilder` to simplify dictionary creation
- Removed `affix::Config` as the representation was limiting & clunky
- The methods on `Dictionary` are now infallible since an uncompiled dictionary
  can no longer be created
- Rewrote the `error` module
- Simplified imports, everything needed is now top-level
- Rewrote affix file parser so it is much more efficient and now handles all
  known keys. We do not yet act on all possible values.
- Rewrote the dictionary & personal wordlist parsers

### Additions

- `check_indices` is now available to return better information about the
  location of errors
- Python modules now have correct bindings (horray!)

There are also a few new APIs that are feature gated. They should be considered
very unstable until those feature gates are removed.

- Suggestions
- Stemming
- Morphological analysis
- System tools. These were previously public but have been moved behind the
  feature gate.

## [0.2.2] - 2022-11-04

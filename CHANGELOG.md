# Changelog

<!-- next-header -->

## [Unreleased] - ReleaseDate

### Changed

- `.dic` parser now ignores lines that start with a tab (sometimes used for comments)
- Updated python documentation



## [0.3.1] - 2022-12-30

Minor patch to build system workflow


## [0.3.0] - 2022-12-30

This change is a huge rewrite of the library! Hopefully this will pave the way
forward for more features and easier growth.

### Changes

- Added `DictBuilder` to simplify dictionary creation
- Removed `affix::Config` as the representation was limiting & clunky
- The methods on `Dictionary` are now infallible since an uncompiled dictionary
  can no longer be created
- Rewrote the `error` module
- Simplified imports, everything needed is now top-level
- Rewrote affix file parser so it is much more efficient and now handles all
  known keys. We do not yet act on all possible values.
- Rewrote the dictionary & personal wordlist parsers

### Additions

- `check_indices` is now available to return better information about the
  location of errors
- Python modules now have correct bindings (horray!)

There are also a few new APIs that are feature gated. They should be considered
very unstable until those feature gates are removed.

- Suggestions
- Stemming
- Morphological analysis
- System tools. These were previously public but have been moved behind the
  feature gate.

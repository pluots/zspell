//! # Spellcheck module
//!
//! The main operations of this module include [`Affix`], which represents
//! configuration options, and [`Dictionary`], which contains the affix
//! configuration and the implementation to perform spell checking.
//!
//! Please note that the spellchecker is currently in alpha, and really not
//! ready for any mainstream use. Contributions are more than welcome at,
//! <https://github.com/pluots/zspell>.

/// Create a vector of unicode graphemes

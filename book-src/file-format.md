# File Format

ZSpell uses the Hunspell file format, which is described in detail on the
Hunspell manpages (see
<https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/lunar/en/man5/hunspell.5.html> for an
online version). This page seeks to give an overview of the file format, but is
not exhaustive.

## Basic Format

The Hunspell file format has a few separate components:

- An "affix" or "config" file, typically with extension `.aff` or `.afx`
- A dictionary or word list file, usually `.dic` or `.dict`
- A personal dictionary that extends the other files

The below sections describes each file.
